Gridsome sites can be hosted anywhere, even on a CDN. There is no need for a Node.js server. </p>\n<p>A static site gives you many benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>⚡️ <strong>Better Performance.</strong> Why wait for pages to build on the fly when you can generate them at deploy time? When it comes to minimizing the time to first byte, nothing beats pre-built files served over a CDN.</li>\n<li>⚡️ <strong>Higher Security.</strong> With server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs, surface areas for attacks are reduced. You can also leverage the domain expertise of specialist third-party services.</li>\n<li>⚡️ <strong>Cheaper, Easier Scaling.</strong> When your deployment amounts to a stack of files that can be served anywhere, scaling is a matter of serving those files in more places. CDNs are perfect for this, and often include scaling in all of their plans.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"automatic-code-splitting\"><a href=\"#automatic-code-splitting\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a>Automatic Code splitting</h2>\n<p>Every <code class=\"language-text\">import</code> you declare gets bundled and served with each page. That means pages never load unnecessary code while browsing around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-prpl-pattern\"><a href=\"#the-prpl-pattern\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a>The PRPL pattern</h2>\n<p>PRPL is a pattern for structuring and serving Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), with an emphasis on the performance of app delivery and launch. It stands for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Push</strong> critical resources for the initial URL route.</li>\n<li><strong>Render</strong> initial route.</li>\n<li><strong>Pre-cache</strong> remaining routes.</li>\n<li><strong>Lazy-load</strong> and create remaining routes on demand.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">PRPL pattern</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"smart-link-prefetching\"><a href=\"#smart-link-prefetching\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a>Smart link prefetching</h2>\n<p>Gridsome prefetches internal links in the background so browsing around goes insanely fast. It uses the built-in <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;g-link&gt;</code> component and <strong>Intersection Observer</strong> to prefetch when the link is in view. </p>\n<p>Gridsome builds two files of every page. A static HTML and a small JavaScript file. When the website hydrates into a Vue.js-SPA, the link prefetching only loads the JavaScript to render the next page. This results in a faster and smoother browsing experience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/linking\">Learn more about <strong>g-link</strong> here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"progressive-images\"><a href=\"#progressive-images\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a>Progressive Images</h2>\n<p>Gridsome has a built-in <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;g-image&gt;</code> component with automatic progressive image support. In <strong>development</strong> it lets you do real-time image processing, like resizing and cropping.</p>\n<p>In production, the <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;g-image&gt;</code> is served as an ultra-compressed image before the image is lazy-loaded when in view by using <strong>Intersection Observer</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/images\">Learn more about <strong>g-image</strong> here</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"vuejs-spa\"><a href=\"#vuejs-spa\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a>Vue.js SPA</h2>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">gridsome build</code> command generates <strong>SEO-friendly HTML files</strong> that can be hosted anywhere. These HTML files are optimized to load as fast as possible. After the HTML is loaded Vue.js takes over the HTML and <strong>hydrates into a fully Vue-powered SPA.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>When SPA kicks in it only loads small code-splitted JS chunks for next pages.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/hydration.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Learn more about Vue.js and Client Side hydration</a></p>\n","headings":[{"value":"Fast by default"}],"subtitles":[{"value":"Pre-rendered HTML","anchor":"#pre-rendered-html"},{"value":"Automatic Code splitting","anchor":"#automatic-code-splitting"},{"value":"The PRPL pattern","anchor":"#the-prpl-pattern"},{"value":"Smart link prefetching","anchor":"#smart-link-prefetching"},{"value":"Progressive Images","anchor":"#progressive-images"},{"value":"Vue.js SPA","anchor":"#vuejs-spa"}]}},"context":{}}
